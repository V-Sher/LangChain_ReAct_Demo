1.	Recruitment and Selection
1.	Introduction

1.1	Effective recruitment and selection is central and crucial to the successful functioning of <Company>.

2.	Advertisements

2.1	Vacancies will generally be advertised in an appropriate newspaper or journal, and will not be confined to those media which, because of their particular source of applicants, provide only or mainly applicants of a particular group.

2.2	Advertisements will also be notified to the local job centre.

2.3	All vacancies will also be posted on the Company Intranet, and internal notice boards. <Company> is keen to facilitate internal promotions wherever possible as development opportunities for it’s staff.

2.4	<Company> may, on occasions, decide to restrict advertisement to internal candidates only. Furthermore junior posts will always be advertised internally in the first instance, to provide continuous development of existing members of staff unless the Management team agrees that this is not appropriate due to the specialist skills required for the post involved. 

2.5	Vacancies, which are restricted to internal candidates only will be clearly indicated on the advertisement. All internal candidates will be selected for interview on the same criteria as external candidates. 

2.6	Employees on maternity leave will receive all advertisements for posts advertised in the Company during their period of maternity leave.

All applicants with a disability who meet the essential criteria for a job will be interviewed, and considered on their merits

3.5	Applicants will be required to supply the names and addresses of two people from whom references can be obtained, one of which should normally be the applicant's current or most recent employer.

Additional notes may be made by the panel during the interview, however it should be noted that candidates will have access to all information should they request it.
